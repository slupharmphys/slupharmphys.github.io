            <p>Understanding the role of transcriptional repression in acute myeloid leukemia.</p>

<h2 id="header">header</h2>

<p>All processes of living cells, include cancer, are driven by cell-specific regulation of gene expression. A fundamental step of gene regulation is transcription. Transcription is opposingly regulated by repression and activation. Various studies have shown that repression plays a critical role in normal functions of the cells, by preventing in appropriate activation of genes regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. Transcriptional corepressors are a family of proteins that can coordinate the expression of a variety of genes that function in related pathways. MTG16 (ETO2, CBFA2T3) is a member of the myeloid translocation gene family of transcriptional corepressors, which is specifically expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells. We have shown that MTG16 plays a necessary role in maintaining the stemness property of recurrent leukemia-initiating cells. We also found that MTG16 inhibits myeloid differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells in response to all-trans retinoic acid. A better understanding of MTG16 functions can lead to new treatment options for AML, which has a very low survival rate compared to many other leukemia.</p>
